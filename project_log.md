## 2026-02-01: Dependency Injection & Architecture Refactor

- **Context**: Transitioned the application from a Service Locator pattern (static calls) to strictly typed Dependency Injection to improve testability and architectural clarity.
- **Technical Changes**:
  - Converted `UserService`, `AuthService`, `DutyService`, `ScheduleService`, `QueryService`, `AdminService`, `MaintenanceService`, and `LibraryService` to Classes with Constructor Injection.
  - Refactored `lib/infrastructure/container.ts` to be the single composition root.
  - Introduced `actionWrapper` in `lib/presentation/utils/action-handler.ts` to standardize Server Actions (Auth, DI, Error Handling).
  - Updated `housing.actions.ts`, `dashboard.actions.ts`, and `library.actions.ts` to consume services via the Container.
  - Enforced strict layered architecture with new `lib/domain/types` (Zod schemas).
- **Impact**: Breaking changes for any consumers still using the old static service methods. Tests will need updates to instantiate service classes with mocks.
