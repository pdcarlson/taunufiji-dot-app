# Tracks Registry

- [ ] **Track: Scrap the current GitHub Actions deployment strategy in favor of direct Appwrite/GitHub integration. This will simplify the development workflow by managing secrets via local files and relying on branch-based deployments (main for prod, staging branch for staging). We will remove all obsolete deployment GitHub workflows, redundant deployment scripts, and any lingering deployment-specific dependencies.**
